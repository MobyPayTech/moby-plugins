## Key Components

### Payment Initialization

The `process_payment` method in `includes/mobypay-checkout-gateway.php` is responsible for initializing the payment process. It prepares the order data and sends it to Moby Checkout to create a payment link.

### Callback Handling

The `mobypay_callback` method in `includes/mobypay-checkout-gateway.php` handles the server-to-server callbacks from Moby Checkout. It updates the order status based on the payment result.

### Redirect Handling

The `mobypay_response` method in `includes/mobypay-checkout-gateway.php` manages the customer redirect after payment. It updates the order status and displays appropriate messages to the customer.

## Security

- The plugin validates the HMAC signature for both callbacks and redirects to ensure the integrity of the payment data.
- API credentials are securely stored and used for communication with Moby Checkout.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

- ❗ **Ensure WooCommerce plugin is installed.**
- ❗ **Ensure currency is set to MYR.**
- ✅ Ensure your Merchant ID and API Key are correct.
- ✅ Check the WooCommerce log for any error messages.
- ✅ Verify that your server can receive callbacks from Moby Checkout.
